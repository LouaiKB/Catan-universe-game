The adjacent nodes of the builded node will be in red indicating that we will can't build a settlment on them
example: if we try to build on red nodes; we will get an error message dialog.

<br>
After each building the ressources frame will be updated according to the choosen node for building

* The three buttons correspond to the building process; you need to press on build for building settlments, build route for building routes and next player to switch to next player

* Note that if the player is running out of ressources (don't have enough ressources) the building process can't be done!

* Otherwise after each starting dice the player will gain ressources

## Important note
The backend of the project is 100% completed, all the functionnalities and the multiple components are completely coded (Check the code).
It remains to add some functionnalities to the front end to end up this beautiful project :)
